# hide-and-seek
A place to call home. Well not really, but we will be storing our Unity project here

Targeting *Unity3D version 2017.3.1*
**Please ensure that you are running 2017.3 before opening the project**

If you haven't used GIT before I strongly recommend checking out GitKraken which can be found [here](https://www.gitkraken.com/download "GitKraken's Download Page")

If you haven't already joined, you can contact us via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dAe7pqE "But seriously, why haven't you joined yet?") server
